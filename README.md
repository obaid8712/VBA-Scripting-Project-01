Year long collection of data is being accure and sorted by year in MS excel file. Our analytic team used Visual Basic Macro to find the exact data demanded by Wall Street Broker House.

* Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.
* The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.
* The total Volume of the stock

This VBA solution is also included to locate the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume" in each year. 

Wall Street Broker House is also asking to test this VB program on alphabeticlly sorted stock data. Our team developed a new script Alphabtical_MOH and successfuly executed the alphabetical test.
